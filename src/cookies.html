                            Cookies are small text files that are placed on your device (computer, smartphone, or
                            tablet) when you visit a website. They are widely used to make websites work more
                            efficiently and provide information to website owners.

                            cookies" (which remain on your device until deleted or until they reach their expiration
                            date).

                            Some browsers include a "Do Not Track" (DNT) feature that signals to websites that you do
                            not want to be tracked. Currently, there is no industry standard for how DNT signals should
                            be interpreted. Our website does not currently respond to DNT signals, but we are committed
                            to respecting your privacy choices.
